# additionalBrightnessToggle
Gnome Extension to implement additional brightness toggles in the Quick List.

## Scope for Improvements:
  1. Further adding support for multiple screens and making the code block more modular and generalized.
  2. Keymapping for secondary or multiple monitors for shortcut brightness toggling.

## FAQs:
  1. If the brightness toggle doesn't work, check if ``` brightnessctl set ``` does not require superuser access. To fix this run ``` sudo usermod -aG video ${USER} ``` .
